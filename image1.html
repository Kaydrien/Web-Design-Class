  <h1>The Difference Between TCP, UDP, and ICMP</h1>

<dt>TCP</dt>
<dd>TCP offers error correction. When the TCP protocol is used there is a "guaranteed delivery." This is due largely in part to a method called "flow control." Flow control determines when data needs to be re-sent, and stops the flow of data until previous packets are successfully transferred. This works because if a packet of data is sent, a collision may occur. When this happens, the client re-requests the packet from the server until the whole packet is complete and is identical to its original.</dd>
<dt>UDP</dt>
<dd>UDP is commonly used for streaming audio and video. Streaming media such as Windows Media audio files (.WMA) , Real Player (.RM), and others use UDP because it offers speed! The reason UDP is faster than TCP is because there is no form of flow control or error correction. The data sent over the Internet is affected by collisions, and errors will be present. Remember that UDP is only concerned with speed. </dd>
<dt>ICMP</dt>
<dd> ICMP is a required element of IP implementations. ICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it designed to not carry application data, but rather information about the status of the network itself. The best known example of ICMP in practice is the ping utility, that uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. When you ping a remote computer you are actually sending a message called echo request, the remote computer then replies to your message which is called echo reply.</dd>
